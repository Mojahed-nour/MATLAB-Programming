Solving some numerical methods problems with MATLAB programming language to improve ,expand and practice my skills AT MATLAB.


## [ Bisection Method ](https://github.com/Mojahed-nour/MATLAB-programming/tree/master/Bisection%20Method) :
Writing a MATLAB function that uses Bisection Method to iteratively estimate the positive real root of the equation ln(𝑥) = 0.7 in the interval [xl, xu] until εa is less than εs.



## [ Maclaurin series approximation ](https://github.com/Mojahed-nour/MATLAB-programming/tree/master/Maclaurin%20Series%20Approximation) :
Writing a MATLAB function that calculates the approximate value of arctan(x) using the Maclaurin series approximation:
```
arctan(𝑥) = 𝑥 −𝑥^3/3 +𝑥^5/5 −𝑥^7/7 + ⋯ 
```
