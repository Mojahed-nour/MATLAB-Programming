Solving some numerical  problems with MATLAB programming language to improve ,expand and practice my skills at MATLAB.


## [1st# Bisection Method ](https://github.com/Mojahed-nour/MATLAB-programming/tree/master/Bisection%20Method) :
Writing a MATLAB function that uses Bisection Method to iteratively estimate the positive real root of the equation ln(𝑥) = 0.7 in the interval [xl, xu] until εa is less than εs.

## [2nd# Maclaurin series approximation ](https://github.com/Mojahed-nour/MATLAB-programming/tree/master/Maclaurin%20Series%20Approximation) :
Writing a MATLAB function that calculates the approximate value of arctan(x) using the Maclaurin series approximation:
```
arctan(𝑥) = 𝑥 −𝑥^3/3 +𝑥^5/5 −𝑥^7/7 + ⋯ 
```

## [3rd# linear& nonlinear regression ](https://github.com/Mojahed-nour/MATLAB-programming/tree/master/Linear%20&%20nonlinear%20regression) :

I . Writing a MATLAB function that accepts n values of 𝑥 and 𝑦, perform Linear Regression and returns values of r2 and, the model parameters 𝑎 and 𝑎0.

II. Writing another MATLAB function that accepts n values of 𝑥 and 𝑦 (provided as arrays), checks for Linear, Power and Saturation growth rate models, and estimate the values of parameters 𝑎 and 𝑎0 (or 𝛼 and 𝛽, whichever is applicable).

## [4th# 1st Order differential Equation using Mid-point method](https://github.com/Mojahed-nour/MATLAB-programming/tree/master/1st%20ODE%20using%20Mid-point%20method) :

Writing a MATLAB function that solves 1st ODE using Mid-point method to solve The accumulation of mass in a reactor.
```
𝑉(dc/dt)=Qcin-Qc0
```
